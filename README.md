This is a guideline on how to run our files! Our repo is split into two folders for frontend and backend. The guides to run each folder is in the foldes itself!

## Testing the application
In the root directory, a file called `resumetry zach.pdf` is the actual resume of Zach Khong. You may use this resume as a testing resume. Else, you may provide your own!

## Requesting keys
If you would want to actually run our application, please request for the API keys from us through email. Else the application won't work.
